					<p><b>T</b>he city of Madison offers a great opportunity for high speed rail transport. Located in the middle of Wisconsin, it is centrally located to be optimal distances from Milwaukee, Chicago, and Minneapolis. While it is relatively straight-forward for the optimal placement of HSR hub cities, it is much more complicated for the placement of individual high-speed rail stations within those hubs. First we will discuss the effect of station placement, then we will discuss factors contributing to station placement, and finally we will look at specific locations derived from the feasibility study and other station placements within Madison.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div id="section01" class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<p>The placement of high-speed rail in a city is seen “as a factor contributing to the attractiveness of a location for economic activities.” (Willigers et al, 2011). The HSR station is a direct subset of this attractiveness which makes a city more viable for economic growth. An important aspect of station placement bolstering economic development around the area has to do with what is called the “image effect.” (Willigers et al, 2011). The image effect implies that the HSR system would raise the image of a city.</p>

			<div id="section02" class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>In this case for example, “a location with good accessibility, for example near an HSR station, might have a higher status and therefore attract offices even when these do not actually make use of HST services on a regular basis.” (Willigers et al, 2011). This of course implies that HSR stations have good accessibility, which is usually true as stations often have multiple forms of local and regional public transportation and vehicle transportation access. Another important effect that HSR station placement has on cities is the change of the means of transportation into the city. From Willigers et al, a high level of train accessibility might reduce the need for a high level of car accessibility. This is an important factor for vehicle traffic on the major roadways into and out-of the major city center.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div id="section03" class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<p>One of the most important effects that HSR stations have on cities is their ability to revitalize certain areas of the city for economic and residential development. While stations that are placed in the middle of an existing city center could be a good idea, Andersson et al states that “stations that are located sufficiently far away from the urban core will tend to attract new residential development.” (Andersson et al, 2010). This station placement adjacent to the existing city center, according to Urena et al, gives “an opportunity to transform the structure of the city center and also to change the overall city image, by developing new urban projects and attracting high quality services.” (Urena et al, 2009).</p>

			<div id="section04" class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>Stations may also have feedback effects including “higher prices for real estate due to the increased attractiveness of a location near an HST station, and a decrease in car accessibility because a higher urban density can lead to an increase in traffic jams.” (Willigers et al, 2011). This increase in real estate prices could have a positive and negative impact on the immediate station area, as Andersson et al explains, “railway stations should raise the value of nearby properties since they reduce commuting cost.” (Andersson et al, 2010). This could have a gentrifying effect on the nearby communities, forcing some people with certain income levels to vacate the area because of the rising home prices.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			
			<div id="section05" class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>The benefit to this increase in property values “should therefore be better able to attract retail activity than localities away from the station.” (Andersson et al, 2010). This increase in property values seems to be a double-edged sword; as the property values rise, lower income residents are forced to move out, however more retail opportunities and development is also added to the city. This is an important topic to take a closer look at as the segregation of residents within a city by income is a major factor to socioeconomic barriers.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div id="section07" class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>Two of the major frameworks that are crucial to the understandings of decisions on station location include centrality, which is concerned with “how a potential location is situated within a transport network relative to possible origins and destinations,” and connectivity, which “relates to how well this location is connected to a certain transport network.” (Willigers et al, 2011). Obviously when looking at specific station locations within a city it is more important to look at connectivity, while centrality is more important for regional connections.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div id="map"></div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>The connectivity and accessibility to HSR stations in a city relate to the other transportation means that are available to get to and from the station; such accessibility means include bus, bike, car transport, intermediate rail, and walking. Particularly related to intermediary transportation to stations by bus and walking, in reference to the survey done by Willigers et al, “74% of the respondents who proclaim to be located within walking distance estimate their walking to the station to be 10 min or less. Locations with a walking time below this threshold can be seen as being within acceptable walking distance; within this range the walking time does not significantly influence the utility of the location.” (Willigers et al, 2011).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>An important to take away from these walking times is that above this 10 minute threshold, walking time becomes unimportant and other modes of transportation such as bus travel or car transport become more important. However if the bus and walking travel times are equal, “walking is preferable to taking the bus.” (Willigers et al, 2011). In addition to transportation accessibility, there are other economic and social factors that influence station placement as Willigers et al suggests that “market access, the availability of qualified staff, and the availability of office space are among the location factors that are often highly ranked in studies of location choices.” (Willigers et al, 2011).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>The availability of office space is a very important aspect to consider, especially when looking at HSR station in Madison. Because of Madison’s unique geography, the main city center it situated in a highly selective area where office and residential space is limited. This is why areas adjacent to the city center are important to look at as well. These areas typically have cheaper and more availability of land than areas inside the city center and also gives the city a chance to revitalize an area of the city which needs economic growth or development and also a chance to expand the city center outward as Urena et al explains, “Urban redevelopment projects of large plots of railway and unbuilt land in relatively central areas of big cities, linked to the creation of high-quality resource, HSR in this instance, can simulate the modernization of their city centers with an appropriate mixture of residential, office, commercial, and leisure areas.” (Urena et al, 2009). HSR in this sense not only offers greater accessibility to the city and the region, but also can help aid in the development and modernization of cities to promote growth.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>The feasibility study conducted in Madison for the HSR station placement has previously been conducted on four major sites. These sites include Dane County Airport, Yahara (First Street Station), Monroe Terrace, and the Milwaukee Road Depot (Kohl Center). The evaluation criteria for these four sites included Rail Operations, Vehicular Access, Multimodal Access, Population Access, Traffic Impacts, Parking Capacity, Rail Infrastructure Capital Costs, Site Geometrics, Environmental Scan, and Economic Impact.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>We will also attempt to evaluate other sites listed in a separate document in accordance with the evaluation criteria of these fours sites. These four original sites have many potential problems that are a small part of the evaluation criteria but which could become extremely problematic in actual implementation. For example, at the Kohl Center and Monona Terrace, there is little to no parking capacity.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>As well as being in the middle of downtown Madison, this could severely restrict car accessibility into the HSR station vicinity, greatly limiting the overall transport accessibility in the area. Other sites such as the Dane County Regional Airport on the other hand has ample parking for car accessibility, however because of the site location there are not many bus routes, nor are there sufficient bike or walking routes to and from the area. Out of the four potential sites listed in the feasibility assessment, the Yahara station seems to have the most potential, with car, bike, bus, and walking accessibility, and potential for development of a new station. All four of these stations have in common being inside or part of the current city center.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>What our study can further look into are HSR stations that are located adjacent to the city center, or just outside the city center. Take for instance the HSR station in Lille as explained by Urena et al, “In Lille, the urban development project updated an old one, at the edge of the cities traditional business center and between the city center and the ring motorway, on railway and unbuilt military land, with an area equivalent to half of its city center.” (Urena et al, 2009). Our study will be analyzing not only the current feasibility assessment sites, but will also look at other potential station locations based on GIS data provided by the City of Madison.</p>
